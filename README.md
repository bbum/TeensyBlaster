TeensyBlaster
=============

Repository for all things http://www.friday.com/bbum/2012/03/17/teensy-based-ir-blaster/

The *Arduino* directory contains a basic example program that should provide a quick start for building the Teensy based IR blaster driver software.   It should work on any platform compatible with the Arduino IDE (after installing the prerequisite libraries mentioned in the source, of course).

Overall, the project can be easily modified for any of the myriad Arduino compatible boards.
